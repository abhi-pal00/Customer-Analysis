# Customer-Analysis

### Business Problem

- Our agency has taken over the performance marketing efforts for a Supplement Brand, a brand that parted ways with their previous agency due to dissatifaction with their declining ROAS. In the first month under our agency guidance (February), optimizations were implemented, resulting in an apparent improvement in ROAS. However, this improvement is primarily attributed to an increase in repetitive purchases, with a notable lack of new customer acquisitions. Upon reviewing the performance metrics, you observe that the cost of acquiring new customers (CAC) has seemingly increased from the previous month (January), despite your agency's optimizations.

### Objective

- Analyze the datasets and articulate issues which has been identified that explains the discrepancy in the cost of acquiring new customers. 

### Strategic recommendations

- There has been increase in cancellation since the month of January. So, need to look at the Delivery funnel where the cancellation occured and what was the reason to uncrease the customers.
- Click Through Rate (CTR) and Cost Per Click (CPC) has been better in the Google Channel. So, marketing spends can be shifted through to the different channel.
